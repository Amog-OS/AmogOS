## General Info

This was mostly inspired by [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmint/comments/n9h7b4/amogos_custom_background_mint_x_grey_theme/). AmogOS is a meme OS based on the hit game Among Us, in the same vein as Hannah Montana Linux, but it's also developed and made to be a lightweight operating system. AmogOS is also less bloated than some other distros (*cough cough* Ubuntu). `Chad AmogOS vs bloated mainstream distro`, as youtuber TechHut put it. Don't take this too seriously :p

## Install
**Grab install instructions and the download links here on our website: https://amog-os.github.io/install.html.**
- (please note that by downloading AmogOS, you have an increased chance of being infected with the sussy amogus and AMOGID-69 virus. Please refer to [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFstpT_YTro) for treatment methods).
### Notes
- **We are not responsible for ANY KIND OF DATA LOSS or any kind of problem not relating to AmogOS, USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.**
- **AmogOS was never intended to be a replacement for mainstream distributions; it's merely a joke and a sussy OS.**
- For x64 users: It takes like a whole 69420 secs to load the UI from usb boot so be patient!

## Website
- Our only official website is https://amog-os.github.io/, designed by **our** web developer Fengzi (he's too sus to keep his full name here).

## Merch
- Now stocking very sus stickers, shirts and other sussy stuff. All proceeds will be used to feed our developers and hire artists: https://amogos.myspreadshop.com/.

## Support
- https://discord.gg/6ut87Hqukr (also see our partner project Jostro! https://discord.gg/jr469efBZM).

## Features
- Incredibly sussy
- Custom wallpapers and start menu icon that can be found in `~/Pictures/.AmogOS/`. (or download them [here](https://github.com/Amog-OS/AmogOS-Wallpapers))
- Grey color palette to match Among Us tablet 😳
- Custom neofetch logo
- [FOSS Minecraft](https://gitea.thebrokenrail.com/TheBrokenRail/minecraft-pi-reborn/minecraft-pi-reborn)
- Uses Openbox WM and LXDE, allowing you to switch to 2 desktop spaces with the scroll wheel, similar to macOS
- [among-sus](https://git.sr.ht/~martijnbraam/among-sus), an open-source among us alternative playable in terminal (use "among-sus-server" to host a localhost server and `among-sus` to connect to a server hosted on the current device, or `nc <ip on your LAN network>` to join a game on your network)
- -69% compliance with the [SUS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification) specification

### RPI only features, not present on x86_64 build
- 64-bit kernel enabled by default for speed, as well as to enable Wine support on devices earlier than the Raspberry Pi 4.
- Preinstalled CommanderPi, Pi Power Tools, pi-apps, Colour Emoji Font, and Stacer.
- Wine + Box86 preinstalled for x86 windows syscall translation.
- piKiss and Pi-Apps preinstalled so you can install some games and also A M O N G U S.
(Among Us will run at ~5 fps on multiplayer play. It runs rather poorly, but for a game never intended to run on a CPU the size of a fingertip with 2 layers of syscall translation (x86 windows -> x86 linux -> arm linux), it's decent. A small resolution is needed for the game to run without poor framerates).

## Sussy Notes
- (RPI version only) Default username is "pi" and the password is "raspberry".
- (x86 version only) Default username is "amogos" and the password is "amogos".
- **AmogOS is not a custom OS, it's just riced RPi OS/Debian Bullseye for RPI and x64 versions respectively. It doesn't have any custom written source code. You can mount the squashfs .sb file and look at the rootfs yourself**
