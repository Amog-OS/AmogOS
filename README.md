## General Info:  

This was mostly inspired by [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/nhomed/cinnamon_amogos_is_complete_icon_art_idea_by_u/) (and also yoinks the icon and wallpaper from it, originally made by `u/_peekatchoo_` on Reddit). AmogOS is a meme OS based on the hit game Among Us, in the same vain as Hannah Montana Linux, but it's also developed and made to be a highly lightweight operating system that can be used as a desktop OS if one really wanted to, and it's a bit ironic that AmogOS is lighter and less bloated than most mainstream distros (`chad AmogOS vs bloated mainstream distro` as Youtuber TechHut put it).

You can also test out AmogOS (legacy) online without installing at DistroTest: https://distrotest.net/AmogOS/.

## Website
- Our website is at https://www.jostroos.ml/amogos, designed by our web developer Fengzi (he's too sus to keep his full name here). Also check out our parent OS [Jostro OS](https://github.com/jostroOS/jostro). The official startpage for AmogOS is at https://www.jostroos.ml/amogos/startpage/.

## Features
- Too sus.

- Grey color palette to match Among Us.

- [MCPI Reborn](https://gitea.thebrokenrail.com/TheBrokenRail/minecraft-pi-reborn) (It's recommended you use the included `gMCPIL` launcher to launch the game).
- Uses Openbox WM and LXDE, allowing you to switch to 2 desktop spaces with the scroll wheel, similar to macOS.
- [among-sus](https://git.sr.ht/~martijnbraam/among-sus), an open-source among us alternative playable in terminal (use `among-sus-server` to host a localhost server and `among-sus` to connect to a server hosted on the current device, or `nc <ip on your LAN network>` to join a game on your network).
- [DollarSkip](https://github.com/CleanMachine1/DollarSkip), a simple C app to ignore `$` signs inputted at the start of a command, for copying commands from online tutorials.
- ncdu and tldr.

## Notes

- Default username is "amogos" and password is "amogos".
- **All versions before 1.3.0 are simply a modified re-image of Debian, and do not contain any source code beyond simple shell scripts that can be accessed by unpacking the rootfs yourself.**
